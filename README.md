CI, short for **Continuous Integration**, is a software development practice in which all developers merge code changes in a central repository multiple times a day. CD stands for **Continuous Delivery**, which on top of Continuous Integration adds the practice of automating the entire software release process. **Continuous deployment** is a strategy for software releases wherein any code commit that passes the automated testing phase is automatically released into the production environment, making changes that are visible to the software's users

***Continuous Delivery** is the frequent shipping of code to a given environment (such as test or production) via manual release. **Continuous Deployment** is the automated release of code to a production environment.*
